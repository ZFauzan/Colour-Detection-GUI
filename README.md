# Colour-Detection-GUI

Colour detection is a common task 
in computer vision that ranges in many 
applications. It proves to be a solution for many 
tasks and an aid for those who are unable to 
identify and distinguish colour. To help combat
restrictions many colour-blind people face, we
developed an application that correctly identifies 
colours in an image and presents the resulting 
data in regards to the colours found in the image. 
Images are obtained by taking a picture or having 
an existing image ready. It is then processed by 
using the Python libraries OpenCV, pandas, and 
scikit-learn. Depending on the selection of the 
user, the user is able to extract a specific colour at 
any location in the image and receive data in 
regards to the most dominant colours and 
proportions of those colours. 

To run this application, execute the GUI.py file.
